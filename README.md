# Retail Sales Analysis (SQL)

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using **MySQL**.  
The goal of the analysis is to explore sales patterns, customer behavior, and key business metrics through SQL queries.

The project is structured as a simple but complete SQL portfolio example, covering data exploration, data cleaning, and answering business-driven questions.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains retail transaction records with the following information:
- Transaction date and time
- Customer details (ID, gender, age)
- Product category
